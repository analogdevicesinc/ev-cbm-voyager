VERSION 0.6 - 27th Oct 2021

- Added support for Terminal mode so that data could be collected from more than one mote (Voyager platform) in parallel.
    - New Command: 
      python CBM_app.py com<PORT_NUM> <SAMP_FREQ> <NUM_SAMPLES> <NUM_STAGES> <EN_AXES_XYZ> <SLEEP_DURATION_S> <OFFSET_REMOVAL> <NUM_MOTES>
      
      E.g.: python CBM_app.py com9 500 1024 2 110 120 1 0 1

- Fixed a bug where the X axes data collection could not be disabled
- In Terminal mode, an extra stage is no longer performed after terminal mode shuts down. Only the user programmed number of stages are performed
- Fixed bug in GUI relating to peak-peak measurement

VERSION 0.5 - 30th July 2021

- Configurable low power sleep mode after one frame of data is collected per axis to enable more realistic use cases.
- Control the sampling frequency of the ADCs, with 1Hz resolution.
- Control which axes Voyager collects data from, via the GUI.
- Control the number of samples that are collected per frame.
- Voyager’s 1GB external flash chip has been utilised. Up to 1/3GB of data per axis can be sampled continuously, at the desired sampling frequency, with no time gaps.
    - Note, if the number of samples per frame exceeds 1024 then FFT is not calculated.
- Additional means of removing ADC offset. Assumes the mote is in the vertical position i.e., G in X and Y axes = 0. G in Z axis = 1.
- Terminal (non-GUI) mode.
- Handshaking between Voyager and Manager keeps the two in sync and stops Voyager collecting data that will not be observed.
- Fixed a scaling issue within the GUI which caused G values to be misrepresented.
