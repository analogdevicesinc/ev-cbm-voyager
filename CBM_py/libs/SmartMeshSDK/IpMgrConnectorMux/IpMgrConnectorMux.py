    # The radiotestTx command allows the user to initiate a radio transmission test. It may only be executed if the manager has been booted up in radiotest mode (see setNetworkConfig command). Four types of transmission tests are supported:

    # - Packet transmission
    # - Continuous modulation (CM)
    # - Continuous wave, i.e unmodulated signal (CW)
    # - Packet transmission with clear channel assessment (CCA) enabled (Available in Manager > 1.3.x)
    # 
    # In a packet transmission test, the device generates a repeatCnt number of packet sequences. Each sequence consists of up to 10 packets with configurable size and delays. Each packet starts with a PHY preamble (5 bytes), followed by a PHY length field (1 byte), followed by data payload of up to 125 bytes, and finally a 2-byte 802.15.4 CRC at the end. Byte 0 of the payload contains stationId of the sender. Bytes 1 and 2 contain the packet number (in big-endian format) that increments with every packet transmitted. Bytes 3..N contain a counter (from 0..N-2) that increments with every byte inside payload. Transmissions occur on the set of channels defined by chanMask , selected in pseudo-random order.
    # 
    # In a continuous modulation test, the device generates continuous pseudo-random modulated signal, centered at the specified channel. The test is stopped by resetting the device.
    #

    # The sendIP command sends a 6LoWPAN packet to a mote in the network. The response contains a callback Id. When the manager injects the packet into the network, it will generate a packetSent notification with the calllbackId. The application is responsible for constructing a valid 6LoWPAN packet. The packet is sent to the mote best-effort, so the application should deal with responses and timeouts, if any.
    # 
    # The sendIP command should be used by applications that require end-to-end IP connectivity. For applications that do not require end-to-end IP connectivity, the sendData command provides a simpler interface without requiring the application to understand 6LoWPAN encapsulation. For a more comprehensive discussion of the distinction, see the SmartMesh IP Network User Guide.
